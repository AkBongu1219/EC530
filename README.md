## ASSIGNMENT 1
### GeoLocation Matcher
This Python script matches random geolocation points (latitude, longitude) from two arrays and calculates the closest points using the Haversine formula to measure distance.

### Features
__Random Geolocation Generation__ 
Generates two arrays of random valid GPS coordinates.
Distance Calculation: Uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two GPS points.
Closest Point Matching: Matches each point in one array to the closest point in the other array.
__How It Works__
Two arrays of random geolocations are generated.
For each point in the first array, the script finds the closest point in the second array based on distance.
Results are printed, showing the closest point and the distance in kilometers.
